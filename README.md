# React Dev Assessment - by [Matt Thebert](https://github.com/mthebert/exper-react-assess)

This React app is a simple react app designed to uses an auto-complete search input to display the
selected userâ€™s name and address in the page using TypeScript.

## Getting Started

Clone the app from my repo using:
`git clone https://github.com/mthebert/exper-react-assess.git`

This project was built using:
    NodeJS v21.7.2
    React v18
    Next v14.2.5

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
